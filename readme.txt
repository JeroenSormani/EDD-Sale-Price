Promote your downloads with a sale price!

== Description ==
**Put your downloads in the spotlight by giving them a sale price!**

Numerous studies have shown that people are more likely to buy a product, no matter what, if it is has a discount. Specially if it is something they already wanted to have. The discount will trigger the potential customer to buy your products fast.

Setting up a discount correctly is important, of course you can just lower the price, but then most people will not know the product is discounted. With EDD Sale Price the regular price will be shown with a strikethrough so people will see how much it regularly costs, and what the new sale price is!

Works with both simple downloads and variable priced downloads.

**Look at the screenshots!**

**Feature requests, ratings and donations are welcome and appreciated!**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is the regular price displayed everywhere? =

We try to display the regular price - with a strikethrough - besides the sale price on as many places as possible.

However, due to some restrictions within Easy Digital Downloads, it will currently not display everywhere. We are working on improving this with. (it is displaying on the most important places)

= Why am I not seeing the regular price at the checkout? =

The checkout is one of those places where we improved this. But due to a new change, it does require Easy Digital Downloads 2.3+
